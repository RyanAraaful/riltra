# Riltra

[![ci](https://github.com/RyanAraaful/riltra/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RyanAraaful/riltra/actions)

Riltra is a local code map and project notebook for developers and AI coding
agents. It indexes source code on your machine, helps you follow relationships
between code, and lets you link project decisions to the code they describe.
Use the CLI yourself or connect an AI coding agent through Riltra's local MCP
server.

Riltra's core needs no Riltra account or cloud service and sends no telemetry.
Optional language-server providers are separate programs; they may run project
tools or access the network. Riltra is free and open-source under the Apache
License 2.0 for personal, organizational, and commercial use.

To try Riltra on a repository, start with the [quick start](#quick-start).

## What Riltra helps you do

Think of Riltra as three connected tools: a searchable source index, a cautious
map of code relationships, and a notebook for project decisions. It helps with
questions such as:

| When you ask… | Riltra helps by… |
|---|---|
| “Where is this symbol defined?” | Finding indexed definitions and their source locations. |
| “What calls this function?” | Showing direct call-site evidence. Name-based matches remain candidates; they are not presented as proven targets. |
| “What might this change affect?” | Following bounded, supported relationships. If evidence is insufficient, the impact verdict stays `UNKNOWN`; incomplete coverage is marked `partial`. |
| “Why does this code have this constraint?” | Storing a revisioned project note and explicitly linking it to a source anchor. |
| “Can my coding agent use this context?” | Exposing the same local repository and knowledge queries through MCP. |

Graph and index answers report evidence status and freshness where applicable.
A candidate is a useful place to inspect, not proof that two symbols are
connected. An empty or partial result is not proof that nothing exists or that
a change is safe. This is how Riltra makes uncertainty visible instead of
guessing.

## Available today

The current binary already does the following, offline, with no runtime
dependencies beyond itself:

- **Repository registry** — register local project roots (`init`) and list
  them as deterministic JSON (`repo list`).
- **Git fingerprint** (requires a Git executable) — per repository: HEAD commit,
  branch, dirty/untracked state, worktree detection, and ignore-file summary
  (`repo status`).
- **Health checks** — path confinement, record integrity, and git readability
  checks with explicit pass/fail (`doctor`).
- **Machine-readable output** — stable JSON with fixed key order, meaningful
  exit codes (`0` ok, `2` usage error, `3` repository/data error), and an
  optional `.riltraignore` file per repository.
- **Syntax baseline** — per-file definitions, imports, and unresolved call
  candidates with line/column spans and byte offsets for Python, JavaScript,
  TypeScript, Rust, C, and C++ (`scan`); other extensions are reported as
  unsupported, never guessed.
- **Durable code index** - SQLite-backed snapshots of the syntax facts with
  source digests, provenance, full-text search, and explicit
  fresh/stale/unknown freshness (`index`, `search`); one database file per
  repository under the local Riltra home.
- **Relationship graph** - `callers`, `callees`, `trace` and `impact` answer
  with evidence and explicit labels. Syntax-only relations are
  `POTENTIAL_CALL` candidates matched by name, never proven calls; only a
  semantic provider's source-checked evidence makes a `CALLS` edge, and an
  impact answer is `UNKNOWN` and `partial` unless it is proven. A C++ data
  member is a valid anchor, and `search --occurrences` lists where an exact
  name occurs (member accesses, the address of a member, same-file macro
  arguments) as a labelled name census, not a binding.
- **Opt-in semantic providers** - import a SCIP index (`semantic import`) or
  query a language server you name by absolute path (`semantic query
  --lsp-server`); the answers carry provider evidence and are never silently
  trusted.
- **Knowledge store** - revisioned decision/constraint/benchmark records per
  repository with deterministic export, backup, verification and fail-closed
  restore (`knowledge ...`). A code-anchor binding (`knowledge bind`,
  `unbind`, `at`) links one exact source anchor to one exact record revision
  with a typed relation. Bindings are stored explicitly, never inferred from
  names or paths; a changed source reports `stale` and is not rebound. A
  binding records a relationship, not the truth of the record.
- **MCP server** - `riltra mcp` serves thirteen tools over local stdio: twelve
  read-only ones and one provider-backed tool that starts the operator's
  language server. Reads never create or migrate a store: a missing
  index returns `no-index` without creating files, and an unsupported schema is
  refused as `schema_outdated` with a CLI migration instruction.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: a stable Rust toolchain and `git`. No releases are published
yet — install the CLI from source:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/RyanAraaful/riltra.git
cd riltra
cargo install --path crates/cli --locked
```

This installs `riltra` in Cargo's user binary directory. Make sure that
directory is on `PATH` so your terminal and coding agent can find it. To run
commands from the checkout without installing, use `cargo run -q -p riltra --`
as shown below.

```powershell
cargo run -q -p riltra -- init --repo . --name riltra
cargo run -q -p riltra -- repo list
cargo run -q -p riltra -- repo status --repo riltra
cargo run -q -p riltra -- doctor --repo riltra
cargo run -q -p riltra -- scan --repo riltra --path crates/cli/src/main.rs
cargo run -q -p riltra -- index --repo riltra
cargo run -q -p riltra -- index status --repo riltra
cargo run -q -p riltra -- search --repo riltra --symbol version --limit 5
```

`repo status` prints one JSON line per repository, for example (trimmed,
illustrative values):

```json
{"name":"riltra","root":"…","git":{"present":true,"valid":true,"head":"…","branch":"master","dirty":false,"untracked":0}}
```

`scan` reports symbol names with source locations, for example (trimmed real
output — `…` marks omitted facts):

```json
{"path":"crates/cli/src/main.rs","status":"ok","language":"rust",
 "definitions":[{"kind":"function","name":"version_line",
 "span":{"start_line":38,"start_col":1,"end_line":40,"end_col":2},"bytes":[1464,1527]}, …],
 "calls":[{"kind":"call","name":"registry::load",
 "span":{"start_line":58,"start_col":25,"end_line":58,"end_col":50},"bytes":[2044,2069]}, …],
 "errors":0}
```

Call names are recorded exactly as written (`w.process`, `registry::load`)
and are never resolved to targets — they are candidates for you or your agent
to follow, not claims.

Notes:

- The registry lives in `%APPDATA%\riltra` (Windows) or `~/.config/riltra`
  (Linux/macOS). Set `RILTRA_HOME` to point it elsewhere (useful for scripts
  and tests).
- Git fingerprints need a Git executable: without one, `init` and `repo list`
  still work, while `repo status` reports `valid:false` and `doctor` flags the
  missing executable — nothing is silently faked.
- Run `cargo run -q -p riltra -- --help` for the full command list.

## MCP server (twelve read-only tools, one provider-backed tool)

`riltra mcp` starts a local stdio MCP server for coding agents. It exposes
thirteen tools:

- `riltra_repo_list`, `riltra_repo_status`, `riltra_health`
- `riltra_code_search`, `riltra_code_callers`, `riltra_code_callees`,
  `riltra_code_trace`, `riltra_code_impact`
- `riltra_knowledge_search`, `riltra_knowledge_show`, `riltra_knowledge_related`
- `riltra_knowledge_at_anchor` — read-only lookup of the bindings at a code
  anchor (`knowledge at`); an unlinked anchor stays unlinked
- `riltra_code_semantic` — definition or references at a position, answered by
  the language server the operator configured in `RILTRA_LSP_SERVER` (an
  absolute path). It is the one tool that starts a subprocess: the server may
  write its own index cache and may reach the network, so the server is no
  longer read-only as a whole. Riltra itself still creates, migrates and
  replaces no database through it.

The server never creates, migrates, or replaces a database. A missing index or
knowledge store returns its documented empty/`no-index` result without creating
files; a store with an unsupported schema is refused as `schema_outdated`
without modification, with a CLI migration instruction. Results keep the same
freshness, provenance, and `POTENTIAL_CALL`/`CALLS` semantics as the CLI.

### Connect a coding agent

Install Riltra once using the command above, then configure each coding agent
you use. Each client starts the same local stdio server with `riltra mcp`.
These examples use Riltra's default data directory; set `RILTRA_HOME` only if
you want to store its registry and indexes elsewhere.

#### Codex

Add Riltra to the user-level Codex configuration. Codex CLI and the Codex app
share this MCP configuration:

```powershell
codex mcp add riltra -- riltra mcp
codex mcp list
```

#### Claude Code

Add Riltra at user scope so it is available in all projects:

```powershell
claude mcp add --scope user --transport stdio riltra -- riltra mcp
claude mcp get riltra
```

#### OpenCode

Add this entry to the global user configuration: `%USERPROFILE%\\.config\\opencode\\opencode.jsonc` on Windows, or
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` on Linux and macOS. Merge it into the
existing `mcp` object if one is already present:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "riltra": {
        "type": "local",
        "command": ["riltra", "mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client after configuration and confirm that the Riltra tools are
listed. If `riltra` is not found, check that Cargo's binary directory is on
`PATH`, or configure the full path to the installed executable.

For guidance on when an agent should call each tool and how to read its
answers, see the [agent setup guide](docs/guide/agent-setup.md).

See [docs/pilots/cp7a/README.md](docs/pilots/cp7a/README.md) for the CP7-A
benchmark report, raw evidence, and limitations.

## Correctness evidence

The [multilanguage correctness report](docs/pilots/multilanguage-correctness-2026-11-03/laporan.md)
summarizes engine and provider checks, agent comparisons, and remaining gaps.
Its v2 comparison contains 68 sessions over 17 small fixtures reused from v1;
it is not a general product-accuracy estimate or a performance claim.

## Language support

| Language | Extensions | Syntax facts | Name occurrences | Semantic evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Python | `.py` | definitions, imports, call candidates | no | SCIP import (contract only) |
| JavaScript | `.js` `.mjs` `.cjs` | same | no | SCIP import (contract only) |
| TypeScript / TSX | `.ts` `.mts` `.cts` `.tsx` | same | no | SCIP import, verified on a fixture (scip-typescript) |
| Rust | `.rs` | same | no | SCIP import, verified on a fixture (rust-analyzer) |
| C | `.c` | same | no | SCIP import (contract only) |
| C++ | `.cc` `.cpp` `.cxx` `.h` `.hh` `.hpp` `.hxx` `.inl` | same, plus classes, structs and data members | yes | language server query (clangd, operator-configured); not verified on a real project |
| CUDA | `.cu` `.cuh` | reported as unsupported, never parsed | no | none |

Other extensions are reported as unsupported, never guessed. Headers parse as
C++.

## Known limitations

- Syntax-only answers are candidates. Without a semantic provider, `callers`
  match call sites by name inside a scope of related files, `trace` ends at the
  anchor (no edge has a resolved target), and `impact` is `UNKNOWN`.
- There is no C++ semantic resolution out of the box and no CUDA support. A C++
  project needs a compilation database and a language server you configure.
- Macro interiors and C++ templates are opaque to the syntax layer. `.inl`
  files are parsed as C++ headers; a fragment that needs its header context
  keeps its syntax errors in the `errors` count. `.ipp` and `.tpp` files are
  not indexed.
- `search --occurrences` is a repository-wide census of an exact name. An empty
  list is not proof that a name is unused.
- macOS continuous integration covers the x64 pool only; macOS ARM64 is not
  covered.
- Four C++ capability criteria are not met (status UNMET): C++ method identity for references (`D1-C6`), attribution
  of the external construction sites to the class (`D2-C6`), the full call chain including the indirect dispatch
  (`D3-C5`), and the affected set of an impact query (`D4-C5`). They are accepted pre-release limitations, and C++
  answers stay candidates.
- The repository history still carries machine-local paths from early commits
  (a history rewrite is a separate, owner-gated decision).

## Stability (pre-1.0)

Within `0.1.x` the exit codes (`0` ok, `2` usage, `3` repository/data), the
fixed key order of every JSON document and the MCP tool names are stable; byte
goldens enforce them. New keys appear only behind an opt-in flag or are
appended to the end of a document, and a change to an existing key is made in a
minor version and written in the release notes. The on-disk index schema is
versioned: an older index reads as stale or `schema_outdated` and is rebuilt
with `index`, never silently reused.

## Project status

Riltra is in pre-release development; `0.1.0` has release candidates but no
published release. Continuous integration runs format, compile, lint, and test
checks on Windows, Linux, and macOS (x64) for every change. A manually started
workflow builds the native archives of a release candidate, checks each with a
clean-install smoke and writes their checksums; see
[release/README.md](release/README.md). The M9 evidence is under `docs/m9-*.md`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome under the Apache License 2.0 (inbound = outbound).
Every commit needs a `Signed-off-by` line (`git commit -s`), and
`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` must pass. Details live in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Security

Riltra's core is local-first: it uploads nothing, phones home to nothing, and
never executes a repository's code to inspect it. External providers are
explicit opt-in; a configured language server may run project tools or access
the network. Please report vulnerabilities through the
repository host's private vulnerability reporting — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
